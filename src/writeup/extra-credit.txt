For extra credit, I implemented EnhancedQueryAnalyzer with the blackListing and exact phrase searching functions. 
1. For the blackListing search, what I did is creating a separate Ilist and a boolean statement that identifies
whether the phrase contains "-", and then add the corresponding blackPhrase list to our Ilist. One interesting
query you can try is a string with two hyphens. It should return back to one hyphen. 
2. For the exactPhrase search, I used two boolean functions to identify whether our phrases include parenthesis, 
and then store the phrase with blanks. The potential problem is that I didn't do any other symbol identifications, 
such as "+", "%", "&", etc. One interesting query you can try is a half parenthesis string, i.e, strings that only
contains "(", or strings that only contain ")".
